Concept design.

Thoughts:
- Brand identity. I've been looking at the Humane Tech Web for inspiration (for example: colors and the delete-app icon).
- Artwork based on call-to-action elements and digital environments we are used to, grown up with and tormented by.
- Need to figure out SPOT-ON copy!! Something in the popups or buttons that will make you think
