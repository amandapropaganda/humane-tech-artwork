Concept design - To be continued! 

Thoughts: 
- Play with elements we encounter daily, like Call-to-action buttons, popups, etc. 
- Inspired by the colors and graphic images on the Humane Tech website (the app icon). Brand consistency.
- Easy-to-adapt material. With this you can print, but altso make gifs, or even program interactive popups or something.
- Needs on-point copy!
